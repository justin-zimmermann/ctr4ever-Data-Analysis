# ctr4ever Data Analysis

The goals of this public project are twofold: 
1) gather as much data as possible about past and present records from ctr4ever. The data we have now are the WR Data from 2002-2019, the record logs from 2009-2017, and the ctr4ever SQL database itself (I currently own a 2017 and 2019 version).
2) analyse the data to make statistics and derive meaningful insights about the history and present of the CTR Time Trial community
